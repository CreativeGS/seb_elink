# SebElink
Lightweight Ruby wrapper for communicating with SEB.lv i-bank payment API.  
Solves the cryptographic requirements for you.  

## Installation
Bundle or manually install the latest version of the gem:

```ruby
gem 'seb_elink'
```

## Usage
Please note that for consistency in this gem all hash keys are constant-case __symbols__.

The gem has three elements represented as Ruby classes:

__1. SebElink::Gateway__  
Think of this as the communication adapter. Initialize it with a base64-encoded private key string (the human-readable .pem format). You can store the instance in a constant to reduce processing overhead.  

You can pass an optional options hash as the second argument that will specify default values for communications processed by that gateway instance. Useful for setting company-related data just once.  

```rb
SebElink::Gateway.new(
  <privkey string>,
  {
    IB_SND_ID: "TESTCOMPANY",
    IB_NAME: "Test Inc."
  }
)
```

Additionally, you can rewrite values used by the gem pertaining to SEB.lv i-bank, such as their public key, API uri etc. Here's a complete list:

```rb
{
  IB_VERSION: "001", # which API version to use
  IBANK_CERT: "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----..." # public key/cer of SEB.lv, changes rarely
  IBANK_API_URI: "https://ibanka.seb.lv/ipc/epakindex.jsp" # where to POST users
}
```

Instances of `SebElink::Gateway` have one method for public use:

```rb
gateway.ibank_api_uri #=> uri for POSTing intial message to.
```

__2. SebElink::Message__   
Instances represent requests to i-bank, generally for payment.  

Initialize these with `SebElink::Message.new(gateway_instance, message_code, data_hash)`

```rb
SEB_LV_GATEWAY = SebElink::Gateway.new(<privkey string>)
message_instance = SebElink::Message.new(SEB_LV_GATEWAY, "0002", {IB_SND_ID: ...})
```

Please consult `message_specs.rb` for the full list of data_hash keys.  

Instances of `SebElink::Message` have two methods:

```rb
message_instance.to_h
#=> hash of all fields you need to POST to i-bank API uri.

message_instance.digital_signature
#=> outputs the value of :IB_CRC key, the base64-encoded digital signature of the message
```

__3. SebElink::Response__   
Instances represent responses from SEB.lv i-bank server.  
Well-formedness is not validated since if digital signature is OK, one would think that the bank adheres to it's own spec.  

Initialize these with `SebElink::Response.new(gateway_instance, response_body)`

Please note that the method name `#response` is reserved in Rails, use something else for response variable names!

```rb
SEB_LV_GATEWAY = SebElink::Gateway.new(<privkey string>)

# in a Rails controller context you can obtain the response_body with:
response_body =
  if request.get?
    request.query_string
  else
    request.raw_post
  end #=> "IB_SND_ID=TEST..."

response_instance = SebElink::Response.new(SEB_LV_GATEWAY, response_body)

# Please note that the :IB_CRC signature values will often end with "==\n" which, when uri-escaped will be "%3D%3D%0A", pass the response just like that into the initializer 
```

Instances of `SebElink::Response` have two methods:

```rb
response_instance.valid?
#=> true, if the digital signature is OK.
# DO NOT process responses that are invalid, someone has tampered with the values!

response_instance.to_h
#=> {IB_SND_ID: "TEST", ...}
# Will raise if called on an invalid response_instance
# to override this default safety setting, call with to_h(:insecure)
```

Tests have been written in a documenting manner, so, please,
have a look at the contents of `spec/` directory to get a feel of what the gem can do.  

Version 001 (current) uses the deprecated SHA-1 hashing algorithm. Let SEB.lv know that v2 that uses SHA-256 is needed.
